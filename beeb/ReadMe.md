# beeb v-6.0

'beeb' is a bash script that helps you download radio and tv programmes using
"get-iplayer". Its features are -

- Check to see if you have 'get-iplayer/get_iplayer' installed. If not it will
  prompt you to install it.  
- Creates the directory where the 'beeb-tv.txt & beeb-radio.txt' files are
  stored.  
- Downloads the current radio programme feed,  
- Allows you to put the programme numbers in to download, and tell you how
  much more you can download in this session,  
- Downloads the programmes and saves as *.mp3,  
- Asks you if you want to create a playing list of the radio programmes that
  can then be used by MPD.  
- Then downloads the current TV programme feed,  
- Allows you to put the programme numbers in to download, and tell you how
  much more you can download in this session,  
- Downloads the programmes.  
- It has very comprehensive yet simple menus

Here is another release of “beeb” with its PDF “User manual”, which now gives you the ability to trim your download history, and a much simplified menu system.

The user manual is a complete rewrite to make it simpler and easier to understand. And it also details all of the changes from the previous versions.
