Some useful programmes that I'm hosting here which may stop them being lost from the internet.

**menumaker-0.99.7.tar.gz** = the programme that is so useful for generating menus in fluxbox.  
**mv** = this is the enhanced version of 'move' aka 'mv' which shows a progress-line when used as 'move -g /foo /foobar'.
