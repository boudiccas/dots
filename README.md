This is a repository for all my .dot files, bash scripts, and other files too, which could be useful for other folk, plus it is a secure offline place to store them too.

Further information and documentation about these files can be obtained at [my blog](http://www.sharons.org.uk "A Taste of Linux") http://www.sharons.org.uk
