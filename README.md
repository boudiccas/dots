This is a repository for all my .dot files, bash scripts, and other files too, which could be useful for other folk, plus it is a secure offline place to store them too.

Further information and documentation about these files can be obtained at my blog 'http://www.sharons.org.uk/' aptly named 'A Taste of Linux'.

/bash = various bash scripts.

/emacs = various emacs files

/obnam = files relating to my backup system, obnam.
