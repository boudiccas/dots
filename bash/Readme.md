My various bash scripts that I've written or amended.

**'backup'v5.6** = my homegrown rsync backup file dated October 2013.<br />
**'reinstall'v1.0** = a reinstall script to help doing a restore.<br />
**'reinstall-ubuntu'v1.5** = the reinstall script amended to be used with ubuntu, not tested.<br />
**'show'v2.0** = a script to see a description of a file, whether its installed or not, and what repo its in.
