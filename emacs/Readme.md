My various emacs files.

**.emacs** = current emacs configuration file dated 29-09-13  
**org2bloginstructions.org** = org2blog instructions  
**setup-orgmode.el** = my setup file for using org-mode, complete with lots of commented out code which hasn't yet been removed.  
**init.el** = my current 'init' file which is used in preference to ".emacs"
