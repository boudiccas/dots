My various obnam files.

**notifyv2.2** = my 'push' file, called from $USERS cron, that initiates the backup of /home<br />
**obnam.conf** = my $USER configuration file<br />
**baksize** = my script to show the size of my backup directory sizes in 'conky'
**unlockv2.0** = my script to delete any 'lock' file
